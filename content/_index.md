Hello, my name is Dima and I'm developer.

My first lang was Python but I'm kinda tired of it. I prefer write my projects in Go, but currently work as Python backender (with a bit of Go fortunately).

I'm very interested in ğŸ’» IT history and state-of-art programs.

My biggest wish is to start a business ğŸ’¸ with my friend, experiencing so passionate in work turning it into entertainment, then move to US ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ and live there happily sipping wine and cooking steaks on weekends

Here I'm gonna write anything I want
